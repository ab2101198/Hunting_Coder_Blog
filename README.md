This is more or less look like a template but for understanding it is too good.
This is basic project which only shows blog related to coding and development.
This has basic basic thing like a simple contact form , simple blog page , About page and Home page.
I have used file system to read and write data instead of any database.
All bogs are hard coded and placed in a seperate file.
All contact from data is collected and placed in a seperate file.
